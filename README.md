Excellent idea! Adding a live demo link and visual previews is one of the best ways to make a GitHub project look professional and genuine. It allows people to see your work instantly without having to set it up themselves.

I will update the README for the "Messenger App" to include a dedicated preview section. You will just need to replace the placeholder links with your own.

Here is the updated, attractive README:

# üöÄ Messenger App - Real-Time MERN Stack Chat App

> **Pro Tip:** To get links for your screenshots, simply drag and drop the image files into a new issue on your GitHub repository. GitHub will create a markdown link for the image, which you can then copy and paste here.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Local Setup Guide**

Get the project running on your machine in a few quick steps.

### **1. Get Your API Keys**
You'll need free API keys from:
*   [**MongoDB Atlas**](https://mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register): Create a cluster and get your **Connection URI**. Remember to allow access from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).
*   [**Cloudinary**](https://cloudinary.com/users/register_free): Get your **Cloud Name**, **API Key**, and **API Secret**.

### **2. Set Up the Backend**
1.  Navigate to the `/server` directory.
2.  Fill in the `/.env` file with the API keys you just obtained.
3.  In your terminal, run the following commands:
    ```bash
    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Start the server
    npm run server
    ```

### **3. Set Up the Frontend**
1.  Open a **new terminal** and navigate to the `/client` directory.
2.  Run the following commands:
    ```bash
    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Start the client
    npm run dev
    ```
Your application should now be running locally!

## ‚òÅÔ∏è **Deployment to Vercel**

Deploy your app to the web for free.

1.  **Push to GitHub**: First, push your entire project to a GitHub repository.
2.  **Deploy the Server**:
    *   Create a **New Project** on Vercel and link your GitHub repository.
    *   Set the **Root Directory** to `server`.
    *   Add your environment variables from the `.env` file.
    *   Deploy and **copy the live server URL**.
3.  **Deploy the Client**:
    *   Create another **New Project** on Vercel using the same repository.
    *   Set the **Root Directory** to `client`.
    *   Add one environment variable: `VITE_BACKEND_URL` with the live server URL as its value.
    *   Deploy
